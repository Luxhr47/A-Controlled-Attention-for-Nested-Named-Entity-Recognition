As	O

that	O

Furthermore,	O
we	O

For	O
this	O
purpose,	O
we	O
used	O
three	O
main	O
approaches.	O

The	O
first	O
was	O

The	O
second	O
was	O
to	O

using	O
a	O

As	O

The	O
third	O
approach	O
was	O
to	O

Together,	O
our	O
results	O
indicate	O
that	O

that	O

Hence,	O
the	O

To	O
continue	O
our	O
investigation	O
of	O
the	O
cellular	O
events	O
that	O
occur	O
following	O
human	O
CMV	O
(	O
HCMV	O
)	O
infection	O
,	O
we	O
focused	O
on	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
cellular	O
activation	O
following	O
viral	O
binding	O
to	O
human	B
monocytes	B
.	O

First,	O
we	O
showed	O
that	O
viral	O
binding	O
induced	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
immunoregulatory	B
genes	O
(	O
IL-1beta	B
,	O
A20	B
,	O
NF-kappaB-p105/p50	B
,	O
and	O
IkappaBalpha	B
)	O
in	O
unactivated	O
monocytes	B
and	O
that	O
neutralizing	B
Abs	O
to	O
the	O
major	O
HCMV	B
glycoproteins	O
,	O
gB	B
(	O
UL55	B
)	O
and	O
gH	B
(	O
UL75	B
),	O
inhibited	O
the	O
induction	O
of	O
these	O
genes.	O

Next,	O
we	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
these	O
viral	O
ligands	O
directly	O
up-regulated	O
monocyte	O
gene	O
expression	O
upon	O
their	O
binding	O
to	O
their	O
appropriate	O
cellular	O
receptors.	O

We	O
then	O
investigated	O
if	O
HCMV	O
binding	O
also	O
resulted	O
in	O
the	O
translation	O
and	O
secretion	O
of	O
cytokines	B
.	O

Our	O
results	O
showed	O
that	O
HCMV	O
binding	O
to	O
monocytes	B
resulted	O
in	O
the	O
production	O
and	O
release	O
of	O
IL-1beta	B
protein	O
.	O

Because	O
these	O
induced	O
gene	O
products	O
have	O
NF-kappaB	B
sites	O
in	O
their	O
promoter	B
regions	O
,	O
we	O
next	O
examined	O
whether	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
up-regulation	O
of	O
nuclear	O
NF-kappaB	B
levels	O
.	O

These	O
experiments	O
showed	O
that,	O
in	O
fact,	O
NF-kappaB	B
was	O
translocated	O
to	O
the	O
nucleus	O
following	O
viral	O
binding	O
or	O
purified	O
viral	O
ligand	O
binding	O
.	O

Changes	O
in	O
IkappaBalpha	B
levels	O
correlated	O
with	O
the	O
changes	O
in	O
NF-kappaB	B
translocation	O
.	O

Lastly,	O
we	O
demonstrated	O
that	O
p38	B
kinase	O
activity	O
played	O
a	O
central	O
role	O
in	O
IL-1beta	B
production	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
rapidly	O
up-regulated	O
following	O
infection.	O

These	O
results	O
support	O
our	O
hypothesis	O
that	O
HCMV	O
initiates	O
a	O
signal	O
transduction	O
pathway	O
that	O
leads	O
to	O
monocyte	O
activation	O
and	O
pinpoints	O
a	O
potential	O
mechanism	O
whereby	O
HCMV	O
infection	O
of	O
monocytes	B
can	O
result	O
in	O
profound	O
pathogenesis	O

in	O

However,	O
the	O
Ets	B

that	O

In	O

Indeed,	O
the	O
combination	O
of	O

the	O

this	O

On	O
the	O

is	O
an	O

which	O

to	O
be	O
correlated	O
with	O

some	O

This	O
phase	O
can	O
occur	O
to	O
some	O
extent	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
thymus	O
.	O

However,	O
the	O
profound	O
T	O
cell	O
deficit	O
of	O
nude	O

indicates	O
that	O
the	O
thymus	O
is	O
by	O

the	O
most	O
potent	O
site	O
for	O
inducing	O
the	O
expansion	O
per	O
se,	O
even	O
if	O
other	O

Second	O
is	O
a	O

phase	O

TCR	B

The	O

the	O

mechanism	O
that	O
selects	O

are	O

It	O

that	O
the	O
rearrangement	O

in	O
the	O
gamma	B
delta	O
lineage	O
may	O
not	O

a	O

stage	O
strictly	O
equivalent	O
to	O
the	O
rearrangement	O

and	O
it	O
is	O

just	O
how	O

the	O
two	O

In	O
the	O

however,	O
the	O
final	O

The	O
loss	O
of	O

probably	O
caused	O
by	O
alterations	O
at	O
the	O
level	O

may	O
be	O
a	O

(by	O

negative	O
selection	O
(by	O
abortive	O

leading	O
to	O

or	O
death),	O
neither	O
is	O
exactly	O
the	O
same	O
phenomenon	O
that	O
occurs	O
in	O
the	O
thymic	O

Negative	O
selection	O
in	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
unquestionably	O
a	O
form	O

It	O
is	O
interesting	O
that	O
in	O
humans	O
and	O

cortical	B
thymocytes	O
undergoing	O
negative	O

can	O
still	O

and	O
even	O
be	O
rescued	O
in	O

if	O
exogenous	B

is	O
provided.	O

Perhaps	O
murine	B
thymocytes	O
are	O
denied	O
this	O
form	O
of	O

because	O
they	O
shut	O
off	O
